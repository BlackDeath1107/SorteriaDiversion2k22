Nilanjan; Add Firebase Admin SDK to server:
    The Admin SDK is a set of server libraries that lets you interact with Firebase from privileged environments to perform various actions like:
      1.Read and write Realtime Database data with full admin privileges.
      2.Programmatically send Firebase Cloud Messaging messages using a simple, alternative approach to the Firebase Cloud Messaging server protocols.
      3.Generate and verify Firebase auth tokens.
      4.Access Google Cloud resources like Cloud Storage buckets and Cloud Firestore databases associated with your Firebase projects.
      5.Create your own simplified admin console to do things like look up user data or change a user's email address for authentication.
    Prerequisites:
    1.Make sure that you have a server app.
    2.Make sure that your server runs the following depending on which Admin SDK that you use:
        Admin Node.js SDK — Node.js 12+
        Admin Java SDK — Java 7+ (recommend Java 8+)
        Java 7 support is deprecated.
        Admin Python SDK — Python 3.6+
        Admin Go SDK — Go 1.11+
        Admin .NET SDK — .NET Framework 4.5+ or .Net Core 1.5+
    Set up a Firebase Project and add the SDK:
      1.You must need a firebase project and a service account.
      2.Then you need to install the SDK for the language of your choice.
    Initialize the SDK:
      1.To initialise The SDK you must authenticate the service account by generating a private key in JSON format. Store the private key securely after generating it.
      2.While authenticating the service account you can either set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL as environment variables or you can directly pass the path to the service account key in the code.
    After you've completed the above steps, Application Default Credentials (ADC) is able to implicitly determine your credentials, allowing you to use service account credentials when testing or running in non-Google environments.
    Initialize the SDK as shown:
    default_app = firebase_admin.initialize_app()
